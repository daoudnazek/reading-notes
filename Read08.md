## Controlling the position of an element

**Normal Flow** : (position:static) the normal position.

**Relative Positioning** : (position:relative) moves in relation with it would have been in normal flow.

**Absolute Positioning** : (position:absolute) the box is taken out of its normal flow and no longer affects the other elements.

**Fixed Positioning** : (position:fixed) when the user scroll down, it stays in the same exact place.

**Overlapping Elements** : z-index is a value of number , the higher the number, the closer is that element to the front.

**Floating Elements** : float (left, right, both, none)
