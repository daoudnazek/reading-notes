## Type Coercion And Weak Typing 

To complete an operation javascript convert data types, this is called type coercion. 

Beacuse the data type can change javascript considered using weak typing.


## Truthy And Falsy Values 

Due to type coercion each value in javascript can be treated as true or false values.

Truthy Values are treated as if they are true, while falsy values treated as if they are false.

## Loops 

**For** : it is used if you want to run the code for specific number of times, and the condition is a timer.

**While** : it is used if we don`t know how many times the code will run, the condition here is not a timer, and loop will keep running until the condition return false value.

**Do While** : it is used same as the while , the main difference is that the code will run at least one time, even the condition return false value at first.
